# Project Title

This project consists of three Python scripts that perform various tasks:

## Contents

1. **Restaurant Ordering System**: This script simulates a restaurant ordering system. It displays a menu to the user, takes their order, and calculates the total cost including tax. The menu items and their prices are stored in a dictionary. The script includes functions to display the menu, take the order, calculate the subtotal, calculate the tax, and summarize the order.

2. **Guessing Game**: This script is a simple guessing game where the user has to guess the name of the country that won the 1992 Cricket World Cup. The user has a limited number of guesses. If the user guesses correctly, they win; if they run out of guesses, they lose.

3. **Employee Data Manipulation**: This script manipulates a list of employee data. The data is stored in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an employee and contains their id, name, and department. The script includes functions to modify the employee list into a list of strings consisting of the employee's name and department, generate a list of usernames by replacing spaces with underscores, and map each employee's id to the first letter of their name.

4. **Calculator**: This script is a basic calculator that takes two numbers and an operator as input from the user and performs the corresponding operation. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Getting Started

To run these scripts, you will need Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Running the Scripts

To run the scripts, navigate to the directory containing the scripts in your terminal and type `python <script_name>.py`, replacing `<script_name>` with the name of the script you want to run.
